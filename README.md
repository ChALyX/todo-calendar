## About

This React Todo Vite app allows users to manage todos on a calendar. Users can add new todos by providing a title and a date. The app provides a user-friendly interface for adding todos and displays them on the calendar.

## Functionalities

- Display & view todos on a calendar
- Add new todos with a title and date (each day can have multiple todos)
- Fetches previous todo data from MongoDB database using a Node.js backend
- Creates new todo documents in the database using a POST request everytime the user creates a new todo

---

## Some Bugs/Errors or Things to Improve Upon:

- The 'week' view is broken and causes the app to crash. I suspect it's because of the react-big-calendar' library but I didn't have time to fix this issue.
- There isn't a 'delete todo' app functionality yet except for directly deleting from the MongoDB database
